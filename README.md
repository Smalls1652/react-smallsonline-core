# react-smallsonline-core

This React component library is meant to house the reusable components I utilize for multiple web projects.

## ðŸ§° What does this consist of?

Right now it's mainly utilizing [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and wrapping some of those CSS components into a React component library. I do plan on adding custom functions/hooks I use too, but right now I'm focused on getting my core UI components added.

## ðŸ¤” Why make this?

I personally wanted to create my own component library to:

1. Gain experience creating my own library and understanding how to build one.
2. Gain experience utilizing TypeScript.
3. Make it easier for me to maintain common components I tend to reuse across multiple projects.
4. Reduce my need for relying on other component libraries to be updated to support newer versions of other dependencies.

## ðŸ¤¨ Should I use this?

**Probably not.** For what this component library does, you could easily use [Reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap).
